Project:
Build a fully static web UI for an ERP system for a car rental company.

Goal:
Generate all screens with realistic dummy data and pre-filled forms. This is only a front-end, with no backend or logic, just static pages representing what a real ERP would look like in production. The UI must be organized, responsive and simulate the behavior and structure of a real SaaS dashboard.
